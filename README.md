# **TTS and Audio Generation Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on implementing Text-to-Speech (TTS) and audio generation techniques to produce natural-sounding speech and customized audio outputs. Using advanced AI tools and APIs, it demonstrates the potential of TTS technologies in real-world applications.

## **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TTS-and-Audio-Generation.git
   cd TTS-and-Audio-Generation

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   Copy code
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   Copy code
   python tts_script.py

4. Generated audio files will be saved in the samples/ directory

Examples

Sample outputs are available in the samples folder. You can listen to generated audio clips to understand the project outcomes.

Technologies Used

  Programming Language: Python
  Libraries: requests, torch, librosa
  APIs: AI-based TTS APIs for text-to-speech conversion
  Models: Pre-trained TTS models for speech synthesis
